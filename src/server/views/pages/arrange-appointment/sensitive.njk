    <p>
        Marking information as sensitive means that the information could cause harm or undermine the investigation of a crime if it were disclosed to the person on probation.
        For example, a victim`s personal details.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individuals can make a request for access to all information and records held on them called Subject Access Requests (SARs).
        Sensitive information will not be included in any SARs.
