      <p>
          Marking information as sensitive means that the information could cause harm or undermine the investigation of a crime if it were disclosed to the person on probation.
          For example, a victimâ€™s personal details.
      </p>
      <p>
          Individuals can make a request for access to all information and records held on them called Subject Access Requests (SARs).
          Sensitive information will not be included in any SARs.
      </p>
